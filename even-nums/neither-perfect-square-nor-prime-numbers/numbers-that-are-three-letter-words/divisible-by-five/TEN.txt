YOU MADE IT!

The tenth word is fun because it's different for each of you!

Complete your sentence using the word by your name below: 

Your final word (i know some/most of these are multiple words, but shhh):

Aayushma, Adi, Anna Grace: MOVIE
Arwen, Cannon, Courtney: BOOK
Daniel, Dare, David: BEVERAGE
Donald, Hayden, Humaira: TV_SHOW
Iris, John, Jon Marco: PLACE_YOU'VE_VISITED
Julia, Katlyn, Matt: FOOD
Ryan, Serene, Silas: MUSICAL_ARTIST
Stephanie, Steven, Sydney: RESTAURANT
Zach: COFFEE_SHOP

If we forgot your name on here: treat your final word as:
"A_MESSAGE_TELLING_THEM_THEY_MESSED_UP."

That's all! Go do the thing the sentence tells you.
Hope this was fun practice for using cd and ls!
