YOU MADE IT!

The tenth word is fun because it's different for each of you!

Complete your sentence using the word by your name below: 

Your final word (i know some/most of these are multiple words, but shhh):

Maira: MOVIE
Maya: BOOK
Mike: BEVERAGE
AG: TV_SHOW
Charlie: FORGE_MEMBER (lol)
Lukas: PLACE_YOU'VE_VISITED
Josh: FOOD
Cannon: MUSICAL_ARTIST
Roger: RESTAURANT
Courtney: COFFEE_SHOP
Abby: COURSE_TAKEN_AT_UVA
Cameron: TYPE_OF_WEATHER

If we forgot your name on here: treat your final word as:
"A_MESSAGE_TELLING_THEM_THEY_MESSED_UP."

That's all! Go do the thing the sentence tells you.
Hope this was fun practice for using cd and ls!
